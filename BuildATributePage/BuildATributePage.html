            <p class="text-left"><small>The EU was created in the aftermath of the Second World War. The first steps were to foster economic cooperation:
                the idea being that countries who trade with one another become economically interdependent and so more likely
                to avoid conflict.</small></p>
            <p class="text-left"><small>The Union is a politico-economic union of 28 member states that are located primarily in Europe. It covers an
                area of 4,324,782 km2, with an estimated population of over 508 million.</small></p>
